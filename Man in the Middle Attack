Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM)
A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker intercepts the communication between two devices on a network, gaining unauthorized access to data. This type of attack allows the attacker to read, modify, 
or redirect traffic without the knowledge of the communicating parties.
________________________________________
Definition and Explanation
•	MITM Attack: This is a type of eavesdropping attack where the attacker positions themselves between two devices, intercepting or manipulating data exchanged between them.
•	Spoofing: The attacker uses techniques like ARP Spoofing to impersonate devices on a network by associating their MAC address with the IP addresses of the legitimate devices.

Lab Details
 
Objective:
To simulate a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using ARP Spoofing in a controlled lab environment to understand its methodology and impacts.
Lab Setup:
1.	Hacking PC:
o	IP Address: 10.1.1.2
o	Purpose: Simulates the attacker’s machine, launching the MITM attack.
2.	Target PC:
o	IP Address: 10.1.1.3
o	Purpose: Simulates the victim's machine whose traffic is intercepted.
3.	Gateway:
o	IP Address: 10.1.1.1
o	Purpose: The network router facilitating communication.
Commands Used:
To perform ARP Spoofing:
arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.3
arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.1.1.3 10.1.1.1
•	The first command convinces the gateway that the attacker's MAC address belongs to the target PC.
•	The second command convinces the target PC that the attacker's MAC address belongs to the gateway.
Lab Diagrams:
1.	Network Setup Diagram:
o	Illustrates the relationship between the Hacking PC, Target PC, and Gateway.

2.	ARP Table Screenshots:
o	Show the spoofed MAC address of the hacker on both the gateway and the target PC.
________________________________________
Vulnerability Exploited
•	ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):
o	ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses for communication within a local network.
o	ARP requests and replies are not authenticated, making them vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
________________________________________
Methods Used
1.	ARP Spoofing:
o	The attacker sends falsified ARP responses to associate their MAC address with the IP addresses of the target and the gateway.
2.	Traffic Interception:
o	Once ARP Spoofing is successful, all traffic between the target and the gateway is redirected through the attacker’s machine.

What an Attacker Can Do
By successfully exploiting a MITM attack, an attacker can:
•	Eavesdrop: Intercept and read sensitive data such as login credentials and personal messages.
•	Modify Data: Alter the content of transmitted data, such as redirecting a banking transaction.
•	Inject Malware: Introduce malicious code or payloads into the communication.
•	Denial of Service (DoS): Interrupt or degrade network communication by dropping packets.

How to Mitigate MITM Attacks
1.	Enable ARP Spoofing Detection:
o	Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that monitor and flag ARP anomalies.
2.	Implement Secure Communication:
o	Use encryption protocols such as HTTPS, TLS, or VPNs to protect data even if intercepted.
3.	Static ARP Entries:
o	Configure static ARP tables to ensure IP-MAC bindings are fixed and cannot be altered.
4.	Network Segmentation:
o	Separate sensitive systems into isolated network segments to minimize exposure.
5.	Regular Updates:
o	Keep network devices and firmware up to date to patch vulnerabilities.
